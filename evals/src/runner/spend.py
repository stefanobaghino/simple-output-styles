"""Summarize the token spend of the stored rows.

Every live call stores four token counts: the uncached input tokens,
the cache-write input tokens, the cache-read input tokens, and the
output tokens. The totals per tool show what the harness itself
spends, and the cache-read share shows how much of the input comes
from the prompt cache. The summary lands in the md reports only,
because the raw rows already hold the machine-readable counts. Old
rows predate the token fields, so the summary counts only the
measured rows and states when none exist. A row can also hold the
cache-write split by lifetime; the summary states the split totals
when any row holds one.
