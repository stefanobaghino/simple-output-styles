"""Import stored answers from another run.

The answers layer of the explicit reuse: with --reuse-from, the pair
runner imports the answer rows of a source run for the arms whose
conditions match, and generates only the rest. The judge layers chain
off this one, because a fresh generation of the same style and prompt
yields a different text, and a stored judge row speaks about the
stored answer. The import key is the issue #76 key: the style text
hash, the prompt id (under one prompt-set hash), and the model. An
imported row is the source row plus the reused_from marker. Reuse
opens no era: a reused row and a live row are the same row.

Every failure here raises a bare SystemExit with a message, the exit
style of the pair runner.
