# Drift report

Run: {run}

The report measures rule obedience across long sessions. A session is
{turns} scripted turns in one Claude Code session, with the style
active. Each turn resumes the session of the previous turn, so the
context grows. Each session runs {repeats} time(s), and each repeat
rotates the prompt order, so a hard prompt does not always sit at the
same turn position. The linter checks each answer with the rule set
of the style. The rate of a turn position pools the complete
sessions: 100 times the violations at that position over the
sentences at that position. Thus a short answer weighs by its
sentence count and cannot dominate the series. The verdict compares
the slope of the pooled series against a per-style threshold:
"growing" when the slope is larger, else "flat". The threshold comes
from a permutation null: the turn order of each session shuffles,
the pooled slope refits, and the threshold is a nearest-rank
quantile of the shuffled slopes. The same null yields a one-sided
p-value — the share of shuffled slopes at or above the observed
slope — stated for information; the verdict rests on the threshold
alone. The section of each style states
the quantile, the permutation count, and the seed. The
`--slope-threshold` flag replaces the derived threshold, and the
section then states both values.

# Drift report

Run: {run}

The report measures rule obedience across long sessions. A session is
{turns} scripted turns in one Claude Code session, with the style
active. Each turn resumes the session of the previous turn, so the
context grows. Each session follows one coherent script with heavy
turn material, and later turns reference earlier material, so the
model must read deep context while it obeys the style. A coherent
script cannot rotate, so the {repeats} repeat(s) spread over several
different scripts, and the coupling of turn position to content
averages over scripts. The shallow rotated run is the control. The
linter checks each answer with the rule set of the style. The rate
of a turn position pools the complete sessions: 100 times the
violations at that position over the sentences at that position.
Thus a short answer weighs by its sentence count and cannot dominate
the series. The verdict compares the slope of the pooled series
against a per-style threshold: "growing" when the slope is larger,
else "flat". The threshold comes from a permutation null: the turn
order of each session shuffles, the pooled slope refits, and the
threshold is a nearest-rank quantile of the shuffled slopes. The
same null yields a one-sided p-value — the share of shuffled slopes
at or above the observed slope — stated for information; the

and the seed. The `--slope-threshold` flag replaces the derived
