"""Run the blind judge calls of the reader-value checks.

Every judge call goes through the same CLI path as the runner, but a
judge never loads the plugin and always runs with the default output
style. A judge prompt carries one bare text: no style name, no arm
label, and never both answers of a pair. Thus a judge cannot know
which answer is styled. The comprehension questions come from the
shared facts of the pair, in the wordings of both answers, and only
the fact strings travel between the calls, never a second answer
text. The caller keeps the arm bookkeeping in the raw rows, outside
every judge prompt.

Each completed call goes to the sink as one raw row. A later run
reuses every key that the stored rows already hold, so an interrupted
run resumes without loss. With parallel judge calls, the session lock
serializes the row writes, and the rows land in completion order, not
in call order. The loaders read the rows by key, so the row order in
the raw file carries no meaning.

One task pool spans the checks of a pass. A call that depends on an
earlier call stays behind that call in one task, and every other call
goes to the pool as its own task, so a call runs as soon as its
inputs exist.
