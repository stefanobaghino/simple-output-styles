"""Acceptance tests for the linter engine.

The ticket sets the bar per style: the check finds all violations in the
known-dirty sample, and the check reports zero violations on the known-clean
sample and on the traps sample. The clean sample of each style is dirty
under the rules of one designed conflict style, because clean under one
rule set is not automatically dirty under every other; the CONFLICTS map
names the designed pair per style.
