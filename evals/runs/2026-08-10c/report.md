## Call timing

A stored call row holds two times: duration_ms is the model
time that the CLI reports, and wall_ms is the wall clock of
the subprocess. The difference is the startup cost of one CLI
call.

Calls: 192, measured: 192.
Mean duration: 11374 ms. Mean wall: 13940 ms. Mean startup: 2566 ms.

## Harness spend

A stored call row holds the token counts of its call: the
uncached input, cache-write input, cache-read input, and
output tokens. The cache-read share is the cache-read total
over the whole input total.

Calls: 192, measured: 192.
Input tokens: 192 uncached, 98340 cache write, 1782880 cache read. Output tokens: 164743.
Cache-read share: 0.948.
Cache writes by lifetime: 98340 at 5 minutes, 0 at 1 hour.
